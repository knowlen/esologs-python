**First Beta Release!** This marks the transition from alpha to beta status with 100% API coverage.

### Added

- **100% API Coverage Achieved!** All 42/42 ESO Logs API methods now implemented
- **User Data Endpoints**: Implemented OAuth2 user authentication and 3 UserData methods:
  - `get_user_by_id(user_id)` - Get specific user information
  - `get_current_user()` - Get authenticated user (requires /api/v2/user endpoint)

  - Support for token persistence and refresh
  - Security enhancements (CSRF protection, redirect URI validation)
- **Progress Race Tracking**: Implemented `get_progress_race()` method for world/realm first achievement race tracking
  - Supports filtering by guild, zone, competition, difficulty, size, and server
  - Returns flexible JSON data that adapts to active race formats
- **Documentation Improvements**:
  - Added comprehensive troubleshooting guide
  - Added OAuth2 examples (sync, async, Flask, FastAPI)
  - Reorganized docs structure (Getting Started and Development sections)
- **Testing**: Total test count increased from 322 to 428 tests
  - Added 10 unit tests for OAuth2 functionality
  - Added 8 integration tests for UserData methods

### Changed

- **Major Client Refactoring**: Reduced `client.py` from 1,610 lines to 86 lines (95% reduction)
  - Implemented factory pattern with mixins for better code organization
  - Created modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
  - Method factory functions for dynamic method generation
  - Parameter builders for complex parameter handling
  - Mixins organizing methods by functional area
  - Centralized GraphQL queries storage
- **Dual Authentication Support**: Client now supports both client credentials and user tokens
- Updated Client to detect and warn about endpoint/authentication mismatches
- Enhanced authentication documentation with OAuth2 examples
- Moved all auto-generated code to `_generated/` subdirectory for cleaner structure
- Improved error messages to show available parameters when missing
- Added comprehensive documentation for method registration and naming conventions
- Cached regex patterns for performance improvement

### Fixed

- Type annotations now satisfy mypy without `# type: ignore` comments
- Parameter validation errors now provide more helpful context
- Fixed kwargs passthrough issue in report methods preventing HTTP client errors
- Fixed markdown formatting issues in authentication documentation

## [0.2.0a2] - 2025-07-16

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: Moved authentication module (`access_token.py`) into the package as `esologs.auth` so it's included in pip distributions
- Updated all imports to use `from esologs.auth import get_access_token` or `from esologs import get_access_token`
- Authentication is now properly packaged and accessible when installing from PyPI
